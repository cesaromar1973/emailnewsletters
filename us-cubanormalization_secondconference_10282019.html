				  <p> Dear Endorser and Supporters of the 2nd National Conference for the Normalization of US-Cuba Relations/Sisters and Brothers!</p>

				  <p>You have given strong initial support for the Call to organize a 2nd National Cuba Conference on the weekend of March 20-22, 2020 in New York City. The list of prominent activists and organizers, organizations and solidarity coalitions, endorsing this united and inclusive effort continues to grow including  labor, faith-based, and every social justice “sector” of society.</p>
				  
<p>Your efforts are needed to bring more forces into this battle. 
	Please send them directly to our website</p>
				  
				  <p><a href="http://www.us-cubanormalization.org">www.us-cubanormalization.org</a></p>
				  
				  <p>Click on ENDORSE THE CALL and join in this national effort. If you haven't signed on yet, please do.</p>
				  
				  <p>In recent days the Trump Administration announced further assaults on the rights of US citizens and legal residents to travel to the beautiful Cuban island, beautiful in people, history, culture, and social justice as well as natural beauty. This drastically impacts Cuban-Americans and their families. All commercial flights that were taking from the United States to nine Cuban cities, with only an Havana exception, have been summarily and unilaterally canceled!</p>
				  
				  <p>The Donald Trump Administration’s deepening sanctions against Cuba and their growing impact on the socialist island makes organizing this big effort a political imperative.</p>
				  
				  <p>We are determined to politically elevate the issue of the bipartisan Washington economic and travel  sanctions — the blockade — against Cuba, right in the middle of this Presidential, Congressional, and general election cycle in the U.S. </p>
				  
<p>We demand the total and irreversible end of this criminal and vicious policy which will never force the Cuban people and government to surrender! 
	Repeal the entire 1990s Helms-Burton anti-Cuba legislation!</p>
				  
				  <p>We oppose and resist U.S. threats, sanctions, militarism, and interventionism worldwide and, particularly in our Hemisphere, in Latin America, Central America, and the Caribbean.</p>
				  
				  <h2>Mobilize and Organize, Next Steps</h2>
				  
				  <p>The New York-New Jersey Cuba Si Coalition, the National Network on Cuba co-chairs, with leaders of the Canadian Network on Cuba and the Quebec-based Table de Concertation, have taken the initiative, in consultation with the Cuban Institute for Friendship with the Peoples (ICAP) to Call for the 2nd National Cuba Conference. </p>
				  
				  <p>Immediately following the November 1 - 3 Anti-Imperialist Solidarity Conference for Democracy and against Neoliberalism in Havana where this US National Cuba Conference will be presented and supported, we propose to take the next steps toward the establishment of structures and decision-making forms needed to organize a large and successful Conference over the March 20-22, 2020 weekend. This will involve the establishment of an Organizing Committee that can function democratically and with inclusivity (including local and regional representation).</p>
	
				  <p>If you, or your organization, would like to be part of the Organizing-Committee-in-formation, please respond to this email (or register on our website) In addition to the Organizing Committee as the highest decision-making body in the organization of the 2nd National Cuba Conference, we also propose to establish Subcommittees for each of the 4-5 Panels that will be organized during the Saturday afternoon Conference sessions. </p>
				  
				  
				  <p>Initial discussions have supported major action-oriented panels featuring prominent, informative, and exciting panelists on issues such as: Travel sanctions and US-Cuba relations; the impact of Trump’s deepening of the blockade measures on Cuba’s economy, Cuba’s response, and how to organize against it in the United States; Venezuela, Latin America and Cuba; Local and National Legislative Initiatives in the 2020 Election Season; and Cuba’s Medical Internationalism and US-Cuba Medical, Health, and Scientific Exchange.</p>
				  
				  <p>Together we can unleash real political motion and energy in the months ahead and following the conference! Join our united effort to end the blockade once and for all time!</p>

				  <p>in solidarity,</p>
